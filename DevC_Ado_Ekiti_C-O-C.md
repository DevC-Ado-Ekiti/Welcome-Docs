# **DevC Ado Ekiti - Code of Conduct**

 
When you become a member and/or contributor, you’re joining our community of developers and designers who make use of facebook technologies while building their projects. And like every growing community, we practice a few ground rules about expected behavior from everyone. These guidelines cover both online (e.g. mailing lists, facebook group) and offline (e.g. in-person meetups) behavior.
Violations of this code of conduct can result:
* Temporarily banned from the DevC Ado Ekiti Facebook group and/or DevC Ado Ekiti organization on github.
* Permanently banned from the DevC Ado Ekiti Facebook group and/or DevC Ado Ekiti organization on github.
* Permanently removed from the DevC Ado community. 


## Community Guidelines and Anti-Harrasment policy:
